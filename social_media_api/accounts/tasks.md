Step 3: Define URL Patterns
Routing Configuration:
Configure URL patterns in accounts/urls.py to include routes for registration (/register), login (/login), and user profile management (/profile).
- Ensure that registration and login endpoints return a token upon successful operations.
Step 4: Testing and Initial Launch
Server Testing:
Start the Django development server to ensure the initial setup is configured correctly: bash python manage.py runserver
Use tools like Postman to test user registration and login functionalities, verifying that tokens are generated and returned correctly.
Deliverables:
Project Setup Files: Include all configuration files, initial migrations, and the Django project structure.
Code Files: Include models, views, and serializers for the user authentication system in the accounts app.
Documentation: Provide a README file detailing the setup process, how to register and authenticate users, and a brief overview of the user model.
